# Problem Statement
Life is a privilege for some and struggle for some others. It is imperative that we
open our hearts and minds to the people in need of financial support. There will
always be an initiative that drives us the most be it education for all, health for all,
food for all or more. Also, we are overwhelmed by events around us, be it natural
calamities, terror attacks, climatic problems, farmers problems, etc. Build an
application that would enable a user to identify his area of interest and allow him to
view a list of charities in that domain. The application should allow the user to
donate towards a cause of their choice and help them understand how important it
is to give back to the society we live in. It needs to be transparent where they are
able to see exactly how their donations were utilized in the form of videos and
stories from the recipients. The application should work like an aggregator of
charities and segregate them depending on causes and domains. The platform can
be web-based and/or deployable on android.
